# Boston_Blue_Bikes
Used SQL and Tableau to analyze bikeshare data to make recommendations to increase subscription rates
# Purpose
Boston Blue Bikes is a bikeshare program that is looking to boost its subscrition rates. The bikeshare program launched in 2011 and has nearly trippled in size in its first 10 years of operation. An analysis was conducted to better understand the patterns of one time riders and subscribers to create data driven insights to increase subscription rates.
# Data
All Blue Bikes Data was from the Divy Blue Bikes website from years 2016–2019. The data was loaded into a PostgreSQl server and cleaned and analyzed using SQL and Tableau.
# Analysis
Main research question: What observed patterns of riders and subscibers can be used to increase subscription rates?

Questions for analysis:

* Which districts see the highest customer and subscriber rates?

* Which age groups subscribe to the service?

* How do seasonal weather patterns impact customers and subscribers?

* What time of day are most customers and subscribers riding?

* What are the ride patterns of customers and subscribers?

# Findings and Recommendations
The following areas were identified as places or groups to pursue with customer conversion campaigns:

* While Boston has the highest rates of ridership, Everett has the highest ratio of customers to subscribers. Everett is similar to other municipalities that have recently joined the bikeshare program, making those areas a great place to target for customer conversion campaigns.

* College aged students and riders under 30 show the highest ratios of customer's to subscribers, making them target audiences for incentives and customer conversion campaigns.

* Boston experiences seasonal shifts in ridership due to winter weather conditions. Winter months are associated with high amounts of subsciber rides, and summer months are associated with higher customer use. This makes winter an excellent time to reward subscribers and summer an ideal time to convert more customers to subscribers.

* Subscribers tend to ride most heavily during commuter hours and the middle of the day during the weekend.  Customers tend to ride in the middle of the day and the late afternoon throughout the week.

* Subscribers are using the bike service to commute or take quick trips while customers are taking the bikes out for much longer periods of time. Customers are using the stations in downtown Boston more often and subscribers are riding heavily in Cambridge.

Boston Blue Bikes shows great potential for increasing it's subscription rates. The following reccomendations are all based on the data driven insights listed above. 
* Raise the price of one time rides during commuter hours and mid-day rides on the weekend.
* Lower the time limit from 30 minutes to 20 minutes for the minimal fee for a one time ride.
* Use surge pricing benefits to finance subsidies to match MIT's $45 membership and charge $22.50 once per semester for all colleges in the greater Boston area.
* Advertise low income memberships and partner with schools and hospitals to subsidize membership for employees in areas like Everett.
* Expanded winter challenges that reward subscribers for riding in the off season months. 
* Create a seasonal summer membership for $60
